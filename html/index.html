    <!-- Objectives of the Personal Profile Webpage
    The goal of this project is to create a simple personal profile webpage using only HTML. This exercise will test the ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements effectively.
    
    Objectives:
    Create a Header Section:
    
    Display the page title (e.g., "My Profile").
    Add a navigation menu with at least three items (e.g., "About Me," "Hobbies," "Contact").
    Add a Bio Section:
    
    Provide a short biography introducing the person.
    Include an image (either a real photo or a placeholder).
    List Hobbies or Interests:
    
    Display a list (<ul> or <ol>) of at least three hobbies or interests.
    Add a Footer Section:
    
    Include contact details such as an email address or social media handle.
    Use Cases of the Personal Profile Webpage
    Personal Branding:
    
    Acts as an online resume or digital introduction.
    Helps individuals showcase their interests and background.
    Learning HTML Structure:
    
    Assists beginners in understanding semantic HTML.
    Provides practice in creating structured content without CSS or JavaScript.
    Portfolio Showcase:
    
    Can serve as a starting point for a professional portfolio.
    Allows users to expand with more sections in the future.
    Networking & Contact Information:
    
    Enables easy sharing of contact details with others.
    Can be used as a simple landing page for personal use. -->
